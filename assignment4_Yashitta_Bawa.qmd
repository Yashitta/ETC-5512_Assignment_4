## Data Details

### üß† Research Question

This project explores the question: **What drives viewer engagement on Netflix?**

The aim is to identify which types of content‚Äîsuch as genres, release formats, or show types‚Äîtend to receive the highest viewership. In particular, the analysis considers:

-   Whether certain genres (e.g. documentaries, thrillers, reality) attract more sustained attention\
-   Whether newer titles perform better than older ones\
-   What common characteristics are shared by the most-watched shows

This question was chosen because streaming services like Netflix play a large role in everyday entertainment. Understanding what makes certain content more engaging can offer useful insights into viewer preferences, binge-watching trends, and content design.

### üìÅ The Data

Two datasets were used in this project:

1.  **Netflix Engagement Report (Jan‚ÄìJun 2023)**\
    This dataset, published by Netflix, includes total hours watched globally for each title, along with release dates. It reflects real-world viewership patterns and serves as a direct measure of audience engagement.

2.  **Netflix Titles Metadata (from Kaggle)**\
    This dataset includes descriptive information about Netflix content such as title, type (TV show or movie), duration (either runtime in minutes or season count), genre categories, and release year.

These datasets were chosen because they are **publicly available**, contain the **relevant variables** needed to explore the research question, and are **up-to-date** as of 2023.

They are suitable for the intended analysis because: - The engagement data directly measures viewer attention - The metadata enables grouping by format and genre - Both are observational and compatible in structure after cleaning

**Licensing**:

-   The engagement report is published by Netflix and freely downloadable from the Netflix What We Watched site

-   The titles dataset is available on Kaggle under a public license

### üõ†Ô∏è Data Collection and Preparation

**Download Process:**

-   The engagement data was downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet from the Netflix What We Watched website.

-   The metadata was downloaded in CSV format from Kaggle.

**Data Cleaning and Processing:**

-   The engagement report included a non-tabular header section, which was skipped. - Column names were cleaned and standardised using the `janitor` package.

-   The `title` column was standardised across both datasets by converting to lowercase and trimming white-space.

-   Only relevant variables were retained, including title, hours viewed, release date, genre, and type.

-   The two datasets were merged using a cleaned `title` column.

-   Some shows appear in the engagement data multiple times (e.g. one row per season). These were retained for more granular analysis.

-   The `duration` column reflects minutes for movies and season count for TV shows. This limits direct comparisons across formats.

These steps ensured the dataset was clean, merged, and ready for structured analysis and visualisation.
